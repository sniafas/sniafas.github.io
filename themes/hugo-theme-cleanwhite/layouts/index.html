    <p>Stavros Niafas has a major in Informatics Engineering while he also holds two Msc's, in Data Science and in Image
      Synthesis & Multimedia. As a professional ML practitioner has demonstrated experience in both R&D and production
      settings.
      He helps teams to democratize research and reach faster to production production, from driving ML experiments
      and PoC's into mature codebases to support e2e ML pipelines and systems.
      He is a results oriented individual and perceives his craft as a mean to achieve a certain goal.
      While he keeps a high sense of ownership, he genuinely cares to promote and establish a healthy AI culture within
      the teams and seeks ways to
      translate in simple terms, complex notions to non-tech audiences.

      He specializes in computer vision while his research interests expand in other domains of ML, predictive
      analysis, timeseries forecasting and NLP.
      He is also actively engaged in open source contributions, MLOps and systems engineering with strong foundations in
      Linux
      environments. </p>

    In analogue world, photography is his passion and vinyl collection his secret affair.
